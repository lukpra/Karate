# Karate
App written in wxPython for karate tournaments ladder generation.

I learned a lot doing this project. I see my errors now and it does require a lot of work to make it more readible. There is some reduntant code.

When using Py2Exe please manualy add Reportlab to compilation, since Py2Exe does not detect it. 
I reccomend compiling with console output for debug purposes.

#PROJECT IS ABANDONED FOR NOW
What needs to be done:
1. Global flow refactor.
2. Finished asset cleaning.
3. Repaired proper ladder picture generation.
4. GUI overhaul ( no more manual writing gui, it's just a pain )
5. Minor bugs with reading data. 
6. Proper requirements.txt 

# Pip install:

reportlab
